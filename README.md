# Belly Button Biodiversity Analysis

## Overview:
Rosa, a biological researcher at lab, is trying to find bacteria that a food startup, Improbable Beef, could use to help create a beef taste in its plant-based product. Rosa thinks the bellybutton might contain the right bacteria and she's taken samples from many different people. She now needs to create a dashboard to display her findings.

## Process:
dashboard both researchers and participants

### Customizations Added:
I linked a style.css file to the html file so I could add webpage customizations:
- A solid blue border around the entire webpage.
- A light blue background color for the Demographic Info panel.
- Added an image of bacteria found on nih.gov to the jumbotron and adjusted the fonts within the jumbotron to Times New Roman and the color white.
Also made a slight size adjustment in the html file to the div class containing the gauge chart so it fit better.
